# ai-practices

Welcome to the ai-practices repository! This is a personal project where I explore and practice various AI fundamentals, with a focus on understanding and evaluating large language models (LLMs) and their benchmarks. Through this repository, I aim to learn and experiment with the latest developments in AI, particularly how LLMs are assessed on different tasks, challenges, and metrics.
